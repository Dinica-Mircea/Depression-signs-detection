\chapter{AI Model for Romanian Language}
\label{chap:ch3}
\par \quad Multilingual depression detection is highly dependant on the capability of AI models to understand and analyze text from different cultures. This section describes the process of translating English text into Romanian, a step essential for training our AI model to recognize depressive patterns in a multilingual context. We will discuss the selection criteria and the impact of utilizing a specific Translation API to bridge the language gap, thus enabling our model to process and interpret Romanian text with the same level of accuracy as English. 

\section{Reasoning Behind Choosing Yandex}

\quad In our effort to refine our multilingual depression detection model, we referenced a detailed study that assessed the efficiency, accuracy, and security of various Translation APIs \cite{rashmi2020comparison}. This comparative analysis served as the foundation for selecting the most suitable API for our application, which required the translation of text from English to Romanian among other language pairs. The study meticulously compared several leading Translation APIs, including Google API, Microsoft, Systran.io, MyMemory, and Yandex, focusing on their performance in terms of speed, accuracy, security, and the breadth of language support.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Google API} is widely recognized for its impressive language support, capable of translating content across more than 100 languages. This extensive reach makes it a versatile tool for global communication and content translation. Its reputation and prevalence in the market are testaments to its utility and user-friendly interface. Additionally, it's worth noting that while Google API is commendable, it is not a free service, which may affect its accessibility for some users.\cite{rashmi2020comparison}.

\item \textbf{Microsoft's Translation API} is lauded for its quality and security, offering translations among 60+ languages. It stands out for its emphasis on accuracy and stringent security protocols, although its language support is less extensive than Google's \cite{rashmi2020comparison}.

\item \textbf{Systran.io} boasts a high accuracy rate of 99\%, albeit with limitations in recognizing slang, nuances, and culturally relevant phrases. Its security is commendable, positioning it as a reliable choice for many applications \cite{rashmi2020comparison}.

\item \textbf{MyMemory} excels in translation speed but experiences the highest latency among the APIs evaluated. While it supports translations between 80+ languages, the absence of training data for certain language combinations limits its effectiveness. Nonetheless, its security is robust \cite{rashmi2020comparison}.

\item \textbf{Yandex API}, with support for 90+ languages, stands out for its balance of translation accuracy and lower latency compared to its counterparts. Despite its efficiency and broad language coverage, its security features are not optimal for translating confidential documents \cite{rashmi2020comparison}.
\end{itemize}

The conclusion from this study discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each API, guiding our choice towards Yandex API for our multilingual depression detection model. Yandex was selected due to its free access, lower latency, and reliable accuracy across different cultures, making it an ideal tool for everyday translations where security is not the biggest concern \cite{rashmi2020comparison}. This choice aligns with our objective of giving people an easy to use and accessible tool in order to prevent problems that could appear with depression.

Another rigorous study \cite{cambedda2021study} provides a nuanced error analysis of Yandex's translations. Notably, Yandex's performance, depicted in the graph \ref{YandexTranslationPerformance}, indicates a relatively uniform distribution of errors across multiple categories. This suggests that while Yandex does have areas where it lacks consitency, such as Lexis, Syntax, and Article Usage, it generally maintains the core meaning of the translated text. This is critical for our model, which relies on emotion categories to accurately detect depression in text.

\end{figure}

The Lexis category, in particular, displays the highest number of errors, signaling a need for further investigation to understand whether these issues are from the nature of the texts or from challenges within the translation tool. However, it is encouraging to note that error categories such as Grammar, Format, Culture-Specific References, Acronym, and Consistency show significantly fewer errors. These categories are essential for maintaining the general meaning, which reaffirms our choice of Yandex for texts where nuanced meaning is less likely to affect the detection of depression signs.

Further examination of the study indicates that Yandex demonstrates a more adept handling of common language texts as opposed to those with specialized jargon, registering fewer errors in translations of texts with language spoken by the people in a particular country or region \cite{cambedda2021study}. Considering our dataset comprises of Reddit posts, which are typically phrased in everyday language, this finding is particularly relevant. The study also highlights that, with the exception of Article Usage, the disparity in error rates between different text types is negligible, suggesting that Yandex can reliably manage the conversational and informal style characteristic of Reddit communications.

\section{Adjusting to Yandex API's Policy Shift}

\quad We had initially recognized the Yandex API as a superior option, particularly for its cost-effectiveness, as it was freely accessible at the time of study \cite{rashmi2020comparison}. This advantage aligned with our objectives, allowing us to use its translation capabilities without financial constraints.

However, since the publication of \cite{rashmi2020comparison}, Yandex's policy has undergone significant changes. The API, once free to use within a given generous limit, now requires users to possess a registered and legally recognized company to utilize its services. Ihe requirement of company registration introduces a barrier, limiting the accessibility of Yandex API for independent researchers, small teams, or educational institutions.

Given these new rules, we are still fully dedicated to creating a useful and easy-to-use depression detection system that works in many languages. Therefore, we are looking into different approaches.

\section{Shifting to googletrans}

\quad We decided to integrate the googletrans library \cite{googletranslib} into our multilingual depression detection model. It offers a free and unlimited Python library that uses the Google Translate API. This library appears particularly advantageous for our requirements, as it is not only accessible without cost but also does not require the a company registration that Yandex now demands.

The googletrans library \cite{googletranslib} has features that are well-suited to our project's needs. It is recognized for its speed and reliability, as it operates on the same servers as translate.google.com. The library supports auto language detection, facilitating the identification and translation of a wide array of languages without prior specification. Additionally, it provides the capability for bulk translations, which is invaluable when processing large datasets typically found in NLP tasks.

It is also important to acknowledge googletrans's \cite{googletranslib} usage notes. The 15,000-character limit per text may require segmentation of longer entries, and the instability of web-based translation services means that we should proceed with precaution regarding the library's reliability. The developers themselves suggest opting for the official Google Translate API for more advanced applications where stability is very important. Furthermore, potential HTTP errors could indicate temporary bans by Google, meaning that it is needed to keep an eye on and manage how we use our API to avoid any interruptions. Despite these considerations, the googletrans library's free and flexible usage makes it an excellent fit for our project in its current stage.

\section{Optimizing Tokenization for Romanian}

\quad When constructing a multilingual depression detection model, the choice of tokenizer is pivotal for accurately interpreting the linguistic nuances of each language. Our study contrasts the tokenization techniques of English with those adapted for Romanian, based on the comprehensive study of Romanian BERT \cite{dumitrescu2020birth}. Tokenization, the breaking down of text into its constituent parts or tokens, serves as the foundation for pre-processing text data.

BERT's tokenizer for English text employs a WordPiece model\cite{wu2016google}, which excels at parsing English sentences into a sensible sequence of sub-tokens. This tokenizer, while effective, is optimized for the linguistic patterns inherent in the English language, which differ significantly from Romanian. Romanian Bert \cite{dumitrescu2020birth} tailors the tokenization process to the Romanian language's unique characteristics.

The comparative advantage of the Romanian-specific tokenizer over a more general multilingual BERT (M-BERT) model is evident in its proficiency at tokenization, crucial for any NLP task. In the context of our modelâ€™s use case, it was shown that the Romanian BERT tokenizer could break down words into approximately 1.4 tokens on average, while M-BERT reached up to 2 tokens per word for the cased vocabulary. Additionally, the incidence of unknown tokens was drastically reduced by an order of magnitude with the Romanian BERT tokenizer \cite{dumitrescu2020birth}.

This optimized tokenization not only enhances the accuracy of linguistic analysis but also improves the modelâ€™s ability to interpret the text in a manner that aligns with LIWC-22's \cite{boyd2022development} requirements. With better tokenization, the nuances of depression indicators in the text are more likely to be captured, regardless of linguistic differences. This tailoring becomes all the more crucial when the LIWC tool is applied, as it relies heavily on token recognition to categorize and quantify various linguistic and psychological components within the text.

The study's conclusion \cite{dumitrescu2020birth} underscored the superiority of the Romanian BERT tokenizer for the Romanian language, illustrating the benefits of customizing NLP tools to accommodate the linguistic intricacies of specific languages. This aligns with our goal of achieving high fidelity in detecting depressive markers within text, bolstering the model's sensitivity and precision, especially in a language-sensitive context like mental health assessment.

In essence, the custom Romanian tokenizer is not only better suited for handling Romanian text but also exemplifies the importance of language-specific NLP tools in enhancing the performance of models on tasks such as depression detection from social media text.
